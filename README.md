SecurePad
=========

SecurePad can be used to securely encrypt your documents.

SecurePad can be used, among other things for:

- Encrypting files on your hard drive with information like passwords, bank details, and other sensitive information.

- Sending sensitive information across the internet such as through email.

SecurePad uses a powerful and secure cryption algorithm (, see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blowfish_(cipher)), though of course it is always advised that you use a reasonably complex password. It also means you should be careful because there is no way to recover your information if you forget the key you used!

Changelog
=========

v2.2
----

Recompiled with latest plugin files for compatibility with latest Notepad++ (6.5.1). Note that the compatibility break may have occurred before this, I have only tested that it works with this version though it is likely to work with lower versions of 6.5 too.

IMPORTANT: The DLL in this repository is from the original version, and does not implement the cipher mode change. Michael.
